The Firebase authentication error (auth/argument-error) occurs because:
1. Google Sign-In provider is likely not enabled in Firebase Console
2. The app domain/localhost may not be authorized in Firebase Authentication settings
3. The API key might have restrictions in Google Cloud Console

To resolve this:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Enable Google Sign-In provider
3. Add your app domain and localhost to authorized domains
4. Check API key restrictions in Google Cloud Console
5. Verify the Firebase configuration matches your project settings
